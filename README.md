# MonteCarloRender

This is an implementation of a Monte Carlo Photon Transport in scattering media

Current assumptions:
- Homogenous media.
- One detector, circular with given radius, at the origin, parallel to x-y plane, points to positive z direction.
- Supports only 2D transmission mask Target
